## Star Wars API - Encyclopedia
## Project Status
SWAPI - Star Wars API project has complete functionality and has been designed to be almost annoyingly Star Warsy! I intend to expand SWAPIâ€™s usability by pulling in the remaining characters, planets, and vehicles vs the single pages currently being demonstrated.

## Installation and Setup Instructions
git clone --> npm install --> npm start

## Reflection
SWAPI was a four day project built during my third module at Turing School of Software and Design. Project goals were to further develop muscle memory building out React components by leveraging our current understanding of React and adding some more complexity. In this project we utilized The Star Wars API which is heavily nested with additional API calls providing further insight and experience in handling asynchronous JavaScript.
 
Learning to handle heavily nested API calls and handling async issues using fetch was the most difficult part of this project. Another pain point was learning to use fetch-mock  when testing our application. All in all I am pleased with the product we were able to deliver in a short period of time and look forward to increasing its usability as a complete Star Wars Encyclopedia.
